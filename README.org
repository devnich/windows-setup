* COMMENT How to export this document to other formats
** Export to Github-flavored Markdown using Pandoc
Do this if you want code syntax highlighting and a table of contents on Github.

1. Generate Markdown file
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   # Generate markdown file
   pandoc -f org -t gfm --toc --toc-depth=2 --wrap=none -N -s README.org -o README.md

   # Alternatively, generate markdown file with tight spacing for all lists. If a
   # list contains code blocks, Pandoc will automatically format it with wide
   # spacing. The compact_list.lua filter reformats it to remove the whitespace
   # lines.
   pandoc -f org -t gfm --toc --toc-depth=2 --wrap=none -N -s --lua-filter ./compact_list.lua README.org -o README.md

   # Add section headers. This doesn't create clickable links, but it does create
   # section numbers in the document. This is our default.
   pandoc -f org -t gfm --toc --toc-depth=2 --wrap=none -s --lua-filter ./compact_list.lua --lua-filter ./pandoc-section-number-filter.lua README.org -o README.md
   #+END_SRC

2. Delete anything above the Table of Contents, e.g.:
   #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
   -------------------
     Programming in R
     Derek Devnich
   -------------------
   #+END_EXAMPLE

** Export to Word using Pandoc
#+BEGIN_SRC bash
# pandoc README.org -s -t markdown | pandoc --no-highlight --reference-doc=/Users/gilgamesh/Documents/custom-reference.docx -o docs/KL330_setup.docx

# Spacing is wrong if lua filter runs during markdown creation
pandoc README.org -f org -t gfm -s --wrap=none | pandoc --toc --toc-depth=2 --lua-filter ./compact.lua --no-highlight --reference-doc=/Users/gilgamesh/Documents/Templates/custom-reference-test.docx -o docs/KL330_setup.docx

# Testing markdown creation
pandoc README.org -f org -t gfm -s --wrap=none --toc --toc-depth=2 --lua-filter ./compact.lua -o README.md
# pandoc README.org -f org -t gfm -s --wrap=none | pandoc --no-highlight --reference-doc=/Users/gilgamesh/Documents/Templates/custom-reference-test.docx -o docs/KL330_setup.docx
#+END_SRC
